Hi team! I just wanted to share some of the interesting resources/articles that have come from Databricks in the last couple of weeks:

## üß† ML & AI

- [Announcing MLflow 2.4: LLMOps Tools for Robust Model Evaluation](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-mlflow-24-llmops-tools-robust-model-evaluation)
  - the new **Artifact View** in MLflow Tracking simplifies comparing the performance of LLMs across different runs. This data can be downloaded for further analysis, data labeling, etc.
  ![The MLflow Artifact View provides a side-by-side comparison of inputs, outputs, and intermediate results across multiple models](https://www.databricks.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/screenshot_2023-06-07_at_11.46.21_am.png)
  - **Dataset Tracking**, integrated with Autologging, allows you to quickly identify which datasets were used to develop and evaluate each of your models, ensuring fair comparison and simplifying model selection for production deployment
  ![MLflow Tracking now displays comprehensive dataset information in the UI with enhanced visibility into dataset metadata for each run. With the introduction of a new panel, you can easily visualize and explore the details of datasets, conveniently accessible from both the runs comparison view and the runs detail page](https://www.databricks.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/image2_0.png)

This allowed us to keep all data processing, feature engineering, model versioning, serving, and orchestration all in one place."*
