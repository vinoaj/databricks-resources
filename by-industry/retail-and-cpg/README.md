## Sample Datasets
- [<img src="../../assets/img/kaggle-transparent.svg" width="30"> Dunnhumby - The Complete Journey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/dunnhumby-the-complete-journey): "This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included. Due to the number of tables and the overall complexity of The Complete Journey, it is suggested that this database be used in more advanced classroom settings"
