## About

These assets are prepared for [my talk](https://dataengconf.com.au/conference/schedule) at the [**DataEngBytes** conference](https://dataengconf.com.au/conference/sydney) held on 2022-09-29 in Sydney, Australia.

### The Data

The data used in this demo is from the Kaggle competition [`predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/overview).


### The Environment
This notebook is setup to run in a Databricks Workspace. Databricks clusters are already set up with Spark, Delta Lake, their respective SDKs (e.g. `PySpark`), and configured to interoperate with each other. This notebook was developed using **DBR 11.2** (_Spark 3.3.0_)

To set up Delta Lake in a non-Databricks environment, please [follow these instructions](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html)

- [The Ubiquity of Delta Standalone](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/01/28/the-ubiquity-of-delta-standalone-java-scala-hive-presto-trino-power-bi-and-more.html): a JVM library that can be used to read and write Delta Lake tables. Unlike Delta Lake Core, this project does not use Spark to read or write tables and has only a few transitive dependencies. It can be used by any application (e.g. Power BI) that cannot use a Spark cluster. The project allows developers to build a Delta connector for an external processing engine following the Delta protocol without using a manifest file.
