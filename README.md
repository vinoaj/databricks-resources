## Under the Hood: Delta Lake
<img src="https://docs.delta.io/latest/_static/delta-lake-white.png" width="100" alt="Delta Lake Logo"></img>

### Delta Lake
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/920)
- [Releases](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases)
- [Release Milestones](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/milestones)
- [Delta Transactional Log Protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
- [Delta Lake paper](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf) submitted to VLDB
- [TPC-DS Benchmarking guide](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/benchmarks)

### Developing with Delta Lake
- [The Ubiquity of Delta Standalone](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/01/28/the-ubiquity-of-delta-standalone-java-scala-hive-presto-trino-power-bi-and-more.html): a JVM library that can be used to read and write Delta Lake tables. Unlike Delta Lake Core, this project does not use Spark to read or write tables and has only a few transitive dependencies. It can be used by any application (e.g. Power BI) that cannot use a Spark cluster. The project allows developers to build a Delta connector for an external processing engine following the Delta protocol without using a manifest file. 

### Delta Sharing

#### Z-Ordering
- Delta Lake orders the data in the Parquet files to make range selection on object storage more efficient
- Limit the number of columns in the Z-Order to the best 1-4

#### ANALYZE
`ANALYZE TABLE db_name.table_name COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR ALL COLUMNS`
- Utilised for [Adaptive Query Execution](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/aqe.html) (AQE), re-optimisations that occur during query execution
- 3 major features of AQE
    - Coalescing post-shuffle partitions
    - Converting sort-merge joins to broadcast joins
    - Skew join optimisation
- `ANALYZE TABLE` collects table statistics that allows AQE to know which plan to choose for you
