### Developing with Delta Lake
- [The Ubiquity of Delta Standalone](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/01/28/the-ubiquity-of-delta-standalone-java-scala-hive-presto-trino-power-bi-and-more.html): a JVM library that can be used to read and write Delta Lake tables. Unlike Delta Lake Core, this project does not use Spark to read or write tables and has only a few transitive dependencies. It can be used by any application (e.g. Power BI) that cannot use a Spark cluster. The project allows developers to build a Delta connector for an external processing engine following the Delta protocol without using a manifest file.

#### Z-Ordering
- Delta Lake orders the data in the Parquet files to make range selection on object storage more efficient
- Limit the number of columns in the Z-Order to the best 1-4

#### ANALYZE
`ANALYZE TABLE db_name.table_name COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR ALL COLUMNS`
- Utilised for [Adaptive Query Execution](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/aqe.html) (AQE), re-optimisations that occur during query execution
- 3 major features of AQE
    - Coalescing post-shuffle partitions (combine small partitions into reasonably sized partitions)
    - Converting sort-merge joins to broadcast hash joins
    - Skew join optimisation by splitting (and replicating if needed) skewed tasks into roughly evenly sized tasks
    - Dynamically detects and propagates empty relations
- `ANALYZE TABLE` collects table statistics that allows AQE to know which plan to choose for you
