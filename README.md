## Under the Hood: Delta Lake
### Delta Lake
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/920)
- [Releases](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases)
- [Release Milestones](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/milestones)
- [Delta Transactional Log Protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
- [Delta Lake paper](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf) submitted to VLDB
- [TPC-DS Benchmarking guide](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/benchmarks)

### Developing with Delta Lake
- [The Ubiquity of Delta Standalone](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/01/28/the-ubiquity-of-delta-standalone-java-scala-hive-presto-trino-power-bi-and-more.html): a JVM library that can be used to read and write Delta Lake tables. Unlike Delta Lake Core, this project does not use Spark to read or write tables and has only a few transitive dependencies. It can be used by any application (e.g. Power BI) that cannot use a Spark cluster. The project allows developers to build a Delta connector for an external processing engine following the Delta protocol without using a manifest file.
